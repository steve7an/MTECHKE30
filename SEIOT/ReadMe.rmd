The goal of the project was to utilise raspberry pi to build a functional use case.

And the one that we have chosen to focus one is on elderly fall detection.

Using the algorithm from [Kim Salmi](http://tunn.us/arduino/falldetector.php),

plus some modification using the last x th frame vs the current frame to detect for change in the width and height for a detected person,

we're able to successfully detect a potential fall and trigger an alarm if the person has not moved after a threshold limit has been reached.

A simple demonstration can be seen below
