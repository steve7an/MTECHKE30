Title of your project
Elderly fall detection using Raspberry Pi

Short summary of the project
Using camera and fall detection algorithm, borrowed works from Using the algorithm from [Kim Salmi](http://tunn.us/arduino/falldetector.php) with slight modification, the system will trigger a countdown timer upon the detection of a person falling down and being immobilised for a certain period of time. A simple LED lights and sound file is being played to call for help on site and an additional notification via email is also linked to this alarm to get additional help.

A simple demonstration can be seen below

Installation
Just checkout the whole folder and you should be able to run the script as it is after deploying the software to your raspberry pi.
The below guide is useful for setup on the raspberry pi:

How to use it
You can either link this to the camera on your raspberry pi, or trigger the algorithm via a prerecorded video file for training and parameter adjustments.
There are quite a few parameters that you can experiment with to better detect and trigger the alarm due to noise in the background and other potential objects which may confuse the algorithm. The angle of the camera can also play a very big part in how the algorithm will work.
It's possible to setup multiple instances within the same room and use the combined results to better predict an actual emergency.
